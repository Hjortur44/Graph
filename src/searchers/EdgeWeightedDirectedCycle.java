/**
 *  The {@code EdgeWeightedDirectedCycle} class represents a data type for 
 *  determining whether an edge-weighted digraph has a directed cycle.
 *  The <em>hasCycle</em> operation determines whether the edge-weighted
 *  digraph has a directed cycle and, if so, the <em>cycle</em> operation
 *  returns one.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses <em>depth-first search</em>.
 *  The constructor takes &Theta;(<em>V</em> + <em>E</em>) time in the
 *  worst case, where <em>V</em> is the number of vertices and
 *  <em>E</em> is the number of edges.
 *  Each instance method takes &Theta;(1) time.
 *  It uses &Theta;(<em>V</em>) extra space (not including the 
 *  edge-weighted digraph).
 *  <p>
 *  See {@link Topological} to compute a topological order if the
 *  edge-weighted digraph is acyclic.
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation,   
 *  see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/44sp">Section 4.4</a> of
